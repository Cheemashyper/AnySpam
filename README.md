# AnySpam â„¢
## General info
AnySpam is a Python Based Program which only uses 6 Lines of Code to Spam more than 100 words in a minute. It uses [Pyautogui](http://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) to type your text automatically.This is the First Version of AnySpam and there will be more improvements in the future.


## Requirements
* Python - version 3.8
* Pip - version 20.2.3
* Pyautogui
## Setup
You can simply clone this repository to your directory by   
`git clone https://github.com/Cheemashyper/AnySpam.git`

After you have AnySpam Installed, Open the AnySpam directory on your computer  & Edit the **Text.txt** File using any text-editor of your choice.
## Usage
You can run the Script using Terminal by changing your working directory to AnySpam. From there you can easily execute the code by `python3 anyspam.py`

Before Executing the Code make sure you have opened the conversation where you want to spam. After you have run the `python3 anyspam.py` command, Quickly Switch to the Window where you want the Code to Run. The Code is designed so that you have only 5 Seconds to switch. After You have switched your window, The Code will run in the background and your text will be spammed. Make sure that you dont open any other window where the text is being delivered.
